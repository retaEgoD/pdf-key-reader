# PDF Key Reader
#### Made by David Liang. For Max.
This program takes an excel file containing key value pairs, finds all occurrences of the keys in a pdf, and outputs the occurrence values into a text file in a selected directory. The pdf\_reader module contains all logic, pdf\_reader\_gui contains all gui logic. 

The gui can be run (on Windows) by placing both files in one folder and running pdf\_ready\_gui in a terminal via the following, assuming python is installed:
```
python pdf_reader_gui.py
```
Some computers use ```py``` or ```python3```instead of ```python```, so replace accordingly.
